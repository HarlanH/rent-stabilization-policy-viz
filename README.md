DC Rent Stabilization Policy Visualization
==========================================

This was a project for the 2016 National Day of Civic Hacking, 
organized by Code for DC.

# Background

In DC, over half the commercial rental buildings are rent-stabilized,
where rent cannot be raised beyond certain limits. Two particularly
important policies are the usual amount that rent can be raised when a unit
turns over (currently 10%), and the cap on the amount that rent can 
be raised to match another similar unit in the building (currently 30%).

This application simulates a group of buildings of different sizes, where
all units start at $1000, and the policies affect the rents over time. Several
potential alternative policies can be selected, and the background assumptions
of the model can be changed by expanding the menu options on the right.

# TODOs

* Show something about the differences in Small, Medium, and Large buildings.
* Show something like total revenue per building, to illustrate the 
point of view of landlords.
* Make the default proportions similar to the distribution in DC.
